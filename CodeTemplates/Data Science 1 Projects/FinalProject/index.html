    <h1>My Question</h1>
    <p>
      What words trigger a positive or negative response in the chat filter in
      pubg?
    </p>
    >
    <h1>My Data</h1>
    <p>
      I used simulated chat data created in a harvard experiment where a chatbot
      was used to create simulated statements based on real statements said in
      the game PUBG.

    <h1>My Analysis</h1>
    <p>
      After Filtering through each word and removing some filler words, I was
      able to determine that amount of times a word is associated with a
      positive or negative response from a chat filter

    <h1>My Answer</h1>
    <p>
      Generally positive words such as "Victory" and "win" were always
      associated with a positive response from the filter. Other words that may
      not have an inherently negative meaning but are most oftenly used more
      negativley than positivley such as "need" and "chance" were most oftenly
      associated with a negative response from the chat filter
